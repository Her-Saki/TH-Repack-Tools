` This is quite a crucial revelation.@
` Kotone's ESP is not actually foreboding, but rather, it is telekinesis.@
` If my prediction is correct, it would mean that all of the misfortune she was predicting was actually caused by her.@
` And if that's the case, if she avoids using her telekinesis at all, the incidents should stop occuring.@
` I head towards her classroom.

` "The first time around I shrugged it off as my imagination, but the second time was enough to make me notice it for real."@

` She nods.@

` "I see...@ This entire time I thought I had been able to see the future."@
` Says Kotone.@
` She's believed this for years at this point.@
` Being told to let go of your old beliefs must be hard (especially by a guy like me whom she hasn't even known for a month).@
` However, trying to prove her telekinesis is my last hope.@
` If I just accept that she has the ability to forebode, she will remain unhappy and alone forever.\

*08
` If it turns out not to be foreboding, but telekinesis, then her situation will change radically.@
` It's probably useless to order her not to see the future.@ However, she should be able to become aware of it and just avoid using it at all.@
` If she can manage that, she could live as a normal girl.@
` So, for those reasons, I want to prove that Kotone's ability is actually telekinesis.@
` "Make a prediciton now, but when you do, just be AWARE that it could be telekinesis.@ Perhaps then you might learn to control it."

` Kotone still isn't awake.@
` An hour has passed already and she's not waking up.@
` Despite there's usually a time lag between her actions and her exhaustion, this time she became sleepy as soon as she used her powers.@ It might be because it takes a lot of energy (mental strength, maybe?) as I surmised before.@
` I'm once again impressed.@ She did her best and saved me.@

` "The clock is over there."@
` Kotone looks to the clock that I'm pointing at.@
` "Two hours..@ That's a first..."@
` She rushes to get up, but soon after staggers and I catch her in my arms once again.\

` "Whoa, whoa, you still need to rest."@

` "Just a bit longer...@ Please..."\

` "By the way...@ Is this the first time you're this tired after using your ESP?"@
` "Yes...@ Usually, if I rest for 20 to 30 minutes I feel fine, though."@
` "... Thank you."@
` "Huh?"@
` Kotone looks at me confused as I thank her.\

*27
` "You saved me.@ You really pushed yourself hard to do it too."@
` Kotone casts down her eyes,@
` "But...@ I was the one to push you..."@
` She says apologetically.@
` "It was on me.@ I made myself fall on purpose."@
` "But..."@
` "You're always saving me from falling for good, so I really appreciate that."@
` "... Thank you.@ Thank you so, so, so, much..."\

*28
` "Huh?@ Why?"@
` "For risking yourself to prove to me that my real power is telekinesis."@
` "Yeah, I was desperate back then.@ I thought that if I didn't do that, I wouldn't be able to save you."@
` "I've been doing awful things to everyone this whole time...@ I need to apologize..."@
` "I told you, it's not your fault.@ It's all because of that pesky, complex ESP power."@
` "But, if that's the case, that makes it all the more my fault."@
` "Why's that?"\

*29
` Kotone stays silent for a moment and proceeds to say:@
` "It's a secret, but I think I feel comfortable telling it to you."@
` "A secret?"@
` "Yes...@ I'm...@ I'm not an ordinary human."@
` "That you're not ordinary?"@
` ... Well, someone who uses ESP is certainly far from normal.\

*2a
` "Do you know about "haploid"?"@
` "Haploid?@ That has to do with chromosomes and genetics, right?"@
` I have a memory of learning about this stuff in biology class...@
` "Yes.@ A person normally gets 23 chromosomes each from their mother and father, totalling up to 46 chromosomes overall, but I only have 23 chromosomes."@
` "I don't really get it.@ Does it mean you're lacking half your chromosomes?"@
` If you've got half the normal amount of chromosomes, wouldn't that make you half human?\

*2b
` "That's correct, but the important thing to note here is that I could have been born from just my mother alone."@
` "Huh?@ What does that even mean?"@
` This discussion takes a turn for the complex.@
` "Normal people are born from the...@ love of their parents, right?@ I, on the other hand, was born just from my mother."@
` "So that means a child can be conceived only from their mother without the involvement of a male?"@
` Kotone gives a firm nod.@
` "Yes, that child is me."\

*2c
` "But...@ is that even possible?"@
` A child being born without any male involvement...@ Is that why there are so many fatherless children in the world?@
` "It would appear as though I'm the first haploid among humans."@
` "Among humans?"@
` "Yes.@ It has apparently occured from time to time with animals."@
` "Hmm..."@
` This strikes me as a little too outworldish.@
` "Do you understand now why I'm not a normal human?"\

*2d
` "Y-Yeah, more or less."@
` "As soon as I was born, I was brought to a research facility and examined."@
` "Well, I guess that's to be expected."@
` "And the result of the examination determined that biologically I am human."@
` "Hmm..."@
` "However, due to this, the relationship between my parents began to deteriorate..."\

*2e
` "As a guy I feel like I can understand why."@
` Your child is born, but you have no way of telling if it's yours or not...@ I get that it would be a strain between husband and wife.@
` "Ultimately, I'm not a normal human."@
` "Why?@ The examination concluded that you are human though."@
` "But normal humans can't use ESP..."@
` "......"@
` Indeed...@ This haploid thing could be what awakened Kotone's ESP.\

*2f
` "I'm sorry.@ I'm forcing you to listen to this boring story..."@
` "It's fine.@ You were born with ESP powers, so who can blame you for using them?"@
` "......"@
` "More importantly, your predictions of misfortune are now gone.@ This should allow you to make tons of friends."@
` "Yes...@ All thanks to you, Hiroyuki."@
` "From tomorow you're gonna be a new Kotone."@
` "Yes.@ I will do my best to start fresh."@
` "Excellent!@ All is well then."\

*30
` "Of course!"@
` Kotone responds energetically.@
` This is the first time I've heard her speak with a tone like that.@
` "What a relief...@ I've been working hard because I want to see you in a more cheerful mood."@
` "That's so kind of you, Hiroyuki."@
` "Maybe just towards you, Kotone."@
` "......"@
` When I say that, Kotone's expression juggles between happy and troubled.@
` She's so cute when she's embarrassed, too...\

` I smile happily at her.@
` "Well, are you gonna get up?"@
` I ask.@
` "Oh...@ Sure."@

` Seems like she'll be fine this time.@

` "Cold?"@

` No...| that's not it.@
