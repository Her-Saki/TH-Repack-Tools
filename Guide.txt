-Don't use honorifics.
-Retain the same [concepts] of the original. Example: flowery metaphors in H-scenes, places (eg. juku schools), food names, etc. Footnotes for context can be included directly in-game, so feel free to ask for one if you need it.
-Localize jokes freely but try to include the same topic: if the original joke is about fishes, make the localized joke about fishes too.
-In line with the Japanese version, only the MC swears, but not any the girls. Example:
` "Wait, you're interested in her?"@
` When I ask him directly…@
` "I-I guess."@
` Yajima smiles bashfully.@
` Are you fuckin' kidding me?!\

` "Who do you wish to speak to?"@
` Saying your name first is the most basic courtesy, you little…!@
` I adamantly feing not to notice it.@
` "Are you freakin' asleep?@ You should feel lucky this cute maiden is calling you, y'know?!"@

` Dropping her shoulders, Lemmy mumbles something inaudible.@
-The English sentences of the original can be localized / changed if they sound too Engrish.
-Lemmy's speech in Japanese is *slightly* stiff, so making her sentences a bit stiff on purpose helps to reflect that.
