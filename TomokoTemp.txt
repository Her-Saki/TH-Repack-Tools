` After that minimalist speech, Tomoko promptly returns to her seat.@
` As soon as she sits down, she closes her eyes stiff.@
` Sheesh, that aloof introduction doesn't have anything to envy to Akari's…\

*04
` But still, Akari said "I hope we will get along well this year" with a smile, thus adding a friendly tone to her greeting, unlike Tomoko who exuded a cold aura with that intimidating introduction, as if she said "don't talk all-friendly to me."@
` She somewhat looks like the kind of girl who would surround herself with enemies.@
` In fact, some girls are already glaring at her and whispering.@
` Even though she's likely aware of this, she closes her eyes with an unconcerned face and ignores them.\

*05
` When she spoke before, she kinda looked like a little wolf that hates to be surrounded by humans.@
` If memory serves me right, she's from Kansai.@
` I've heard that a lot of Kansai people tends to have a hard time adapting themselves to Kanto, but I didn't know it was this bad.@ Perhaps that's the reason.@
` Or maybe that's just her personality.@
` Well, at any rate, these are only my shallow thoughts.@ Judging others is never right.@
` It's very possible that she's just having a bad day.@
` Yeah, I gotta think deeper about this before jumping to conclusions.

` As I think about that, the introductions end without incidents.@

` "Alright, now that we're good with the introductions, we're going to choose the class president.@ First we'll pick one and then they'll take care of the rest of procedures."@
` So now we're running the elections for class rep.\

` The role of the class rep consists basically in doing odd jobs.@
` No one here is commendable enough to offer themselves to the task.@
` That said, nominating people at random backlashes you so hard you end up voted as candidate instead, so pressing others isn't very convenient.@

` In simple math, if there's a 1-40 chance of ending up as president, this is not another's problem anymore.@
` After we all (myself included) boo off teacher's idea, he gives an awkward smile and says "alright, alright".\

` I point to the ground.@
` With a question mark over her head, Akari unrolls the paper ball.@

` "What about I nominate you?", that's the message is written there.@

` We talk through lip-sync.@
` We've been friends for so long that we're capable of pulling off these stunts.\

*0c
` However, I decide to stop since she seriously hates the idea.@
` I wonder how well she'd do if she stood out to do these activities every now and then…@
` She's already a hardworking girl, and has been respectful with teachers since she was a child, so I think she'd be pretty competent.@
` But, yeah, it's true that she has never been good at leading people.\

` Well, what can I do?@
` I suppose we can cross her out of the list.@

` Tch.@
` "I've had enough of her!"@
` "I'm gonna leave her alone!"@
` I though about that countless times, but every time I do, those red and tearful eyes I saw back then come to my mind.@
` Yeah, she was…| crying.@
` In that empty classroom, she was resting her chin on her hand as she gazed outside the window, her eyes soaked in humilliation tears.@
` She behaved as usual and put a tough front, but there's no doubt that she was really hurt.@
` That sad profile face never leaves my mind.\

` I casually look at my side, at the seat next to mine.@
LoadBG2 05 0a 0a
` Tomoko isn't here now.@
` At lunchtime, she always leaves the classroom at the ring of the bell.@
` And then she comes back just before it ends.@
` It looks like she eats lunch in some other place.@
` Alone, probably.\

*06
` Come to think of it, I haven't seen her alongside anyone yet.@
` At the very least, she doesn't seem to have any close friends in this class, but I don't think she has friends in other classes either.@
` Yeah, Tomoko is always alone.@
` In break time, after school…@ With her nose in the air, she spends her days alone as if nothing else mattered.\

*07
` That said, well, she asked for it…@ I mean, she herself chose that, so this outcome is only natural.@
` She hates hanging out with other people and have fun…@ Or perhaps she's bad to follow other people's pace.@
` Everything about her gives off that "I'm fine by myself" vibes, after all.\

*08
` In short, she's self-centered and has no cooperative spirit whatsoever.@
` In addition, her grades are good, so she tends to look down on others and be arrogant.@ I kind of understand how the people who can't stand her arrogance feel.@
` To be honest, I find her ego a bit annoying, too.\

*09
` That said, this time they went too far.@
` Writing insults in a notebook is kinder-level bullying, but it hurts when they actually do it to you.@
` Tch…@
` They're exceeding the limits of a prank.@
` I have a hunch about who's the culprit, but going to speak my mind with them only for the victim to shout "It's none of your business!" kinda kills my enthusiasm.\

*0a
` However, the real problem here is Tomoko who isn't true to herself.@
` Her tough front doesn't necessarily reflect her true intentions.@
` The meaning behind her words could be inverse, and she actually needs help.@
` I admit that seeing it that way is extremely irresponsible, though.@
` But either way, I can't just leave her alone like this, right?\

*0b
` Yeah, this is a good time.@
` We haven't practically talked since that incident, so this time I'll meet her and slowly talk things out.@
` If I catch her alone, she'll probably listen to me even if only for a couple minutes.@
` I stand up, leave the classroom, and start looking for Tomoko.
